# Chemical Engineering Mathematics

These are some notes (in Jupyter Notebook) I made for the course of Chemical Engineering Mathematics (CH3311) I took in the Autumn Semester of 2022-23. The three notebooks contain explanations and examples regarding:

- Solution of boundary value problems using finite differences
- Solution of boundary value problems using orthogonal collocation
- Solution of partial differential equations using finite differences
