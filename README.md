# Chemical Engineering Mathematics

These are some notes (in Jupyter Notebook) I made for the course of Chemical Engineering Mathematics (CH3311) I took in the Autumn Semester of 2022-23. The three notebooks contain explanations and examples regarding:

- Solution of boundary value problems using finite differences
- Solution of boundary value problems using orthogonal collocation
- Solution of partial differential equations using finite differences

In the course, we learnt:

- Linear Regression
- Gaussian LU decomposition
- Gauss-Seidel Iteration
- Euler Explicit Solver for ODEs
- Euler Implicit Solver for ODEs
- Adam-Bashford Solver for ODEs
- Runge-Kutta 4 Solver for ODEs
- Discretization of Variables to solve ODE-BVPs
- Crank-Nicholson Solver for PDEs

The file 'thomas.py'  contains a Python implementation of the tridiagonal matrix algorithm that is used to solve ODE-BVPs as well as PDE-IVPs as tridiagonal matrices occur frequently.
